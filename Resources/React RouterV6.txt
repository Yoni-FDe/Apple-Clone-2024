Reacting routering version 6
===========================
1. Limitation react has without react router
   - Mulitple page app  vs single page app (SPA)

   - Solution:
       - React router
           - React Router is a  library for routing in react application.
           - t allows you to define routers , which map to different components in your application.
    - npmjs.com
        - Serach for "react-router-dom" and install
    - Official website:
       -https://reactrouter.com/en/main

    - Install react-router-dom
    

2. Implement main parts of react router
    - BrowserRouter
      - <BrowserRouter> component is used to wrap your application and provide the routing functionality.
        - this router add in our application
    -Routers 
      - <Routes> component wraps everything that are dependant on route.

    - Route
      - <Route> components define the relationship between a path and a component to be renderd when the path is matched.
      - Route objects have a path property, which specifies the path to match and a element property which specifies the component to render.
       1. path
       2. element

    - Link
       - <Link> component is used to create links between different routes in your application.
       if we use a (anchor use href) but when ever use "Link" we use  "to" instead of href


3. 404 page and Nessted routes
    - Non existing routes

    - Shared layouts (NavBar and Footer)
    - outlet
        - Outlet component renders child routes within their parent route.
